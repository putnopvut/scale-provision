# Using the "find" module might seem to make sense here, but it returns a dictionary
# of values. Formatting this dictionary into a continuous string is probably possible,
# but it is not obvious how to do it. Why do I want a continuous string? If you pass
# the individual files to the "yum" module, then it runs yum once for each item
# in turn. The "find" module does not return the files in any particular order.
# This means that yum will run into dependency issues since you cannot put the
# files in the proper order. By passing a single string to the "yum" module, it
# is able to magically install the RPMs in the proper order and not run into
# dependency issues.
